<p>To get a picture of what happened to SPARK - before and after the community takeover took place - you'll find all the necessary info in this <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767">BITCOINTALK THREAD</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>25.10.2014</strong> - this is the last statement from the former dev. it's pretty close to the moment when the first issue started that must have convinced him to simply get lost:  <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.msg9329478#msg9329478">bitcointalk.org &gt; 826767.msg9329478</a><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>29.10.2014</strong> - a few days and some fud and wild speculation later, as well some serious efforts to set the mess straight already had taken place. this is when we've got the first fixed wallet: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.msg9364643#msg9364643">bitcointalk.org &gt; 826767.msg9364643</a>.<br>
this moment went a little bit out of focus with the running discussion and all the hassle, but the <strong>29.10.2014</strong> should well be considered the <strong>Official Date Of The Takeover</strong>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>30.11.2014</strong> - <strong>SparkCommunity</strong> organization created on github to provide the repositories and general infrastructure for all future developement.<br>

<p>...such placeholder, many letters, very nonsense, whow!<br>
replacing this nonsense with some real info will be of course NEXT ...at least regarding this page.  </p>

<a id="previously-on-spark" class="anchor" href="#previously-on-spark" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>...Previously On SPARK:</h3>

<p>New version 1.3 released 22nd Nov 2014 - addresses slow block production</p>

<pre><code>-reduced min PoS difficulty
-updated difficulty adjustment formula
-reduced number of blocks required before moved coins can start staking again
-new seed node
</code></pre>

<p>Diff change means a hard fork, set to take effect at block 24630</p>

<p>Following network fork and disappearance of dev I have issued this updated wallet so everyone can get back in sync on the majority PoS chain. Changes I have made have been minor, see BTC thread at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.500">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.500</a> for discussion, and this repo's commit history for details.</p>

<p>The network forked after block 10041, to help ensure this wallet syncs to correct chain I have added a checkpoint for block 10042.</p>
