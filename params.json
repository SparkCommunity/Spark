What Happened To SPARK?\r\n  \r\nTo get a picture of what happened to SPARK - before and after the community takeover took place - you'll find all the necessary info in this [BITCOINTALK THREAD](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767).\r\n\r\n* **25.10.2014** - this is the last statement from the former dev. it's pretty close to the moment when the first issue started that must have convinced him to simply get lost:  [bitcointalk.org > 826767.msg9329478](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.msg9329478#msg9329478)   \r\n* **29.10.2014** - a few days and some fud and wild speculation later, as well some serious efforts to set the mess straight already had taken place. this is when we've got the first fixed wallet: [bitcointalk.org > 826767.msg9364643](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.msg9364643#msg9364643).  \r\nthis moment went a little bit out of focus with the running discussion and all the hassle, but the **29.10.2014** should well be considered the **Official Date Of The Takeover**.  \r\n* **30.11.2014** - **SparkCommunity** organization created on github to provide the repositories and general infrastructure for all future developement.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n### So... Any Roadmap? What Next? And After All, What's The Current State?\r\n  \r\n...such placeholder, many letters, very nonsense, whow!  \r\nreplacing this nonsense with some real info will be of course NEXT ...at least regarding this page.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n### ...Previously On SPARK:\r\n  \r\nNew version 1.3 released 22nd Nov 2014 - addresses slow block production\r\n\r\n\t-reduced min PoS difficulty\r\n\t-updated difficulty adjustment formula\r\n\t-reduced number of blocks required before moved coins can start staking again\r\n\t-new seed node\r\n\r\nDiff change means a hard fork, set to take effect at block 24630\r\n\r\nFollowing network fork and disappearance of dev I have issued this updated wallet so everyone can get back in sync on the majority PoS chain. Changes I have made have been minor, see BTC thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.500 for discussion, and this repo's commit history for details.\r\n\r\nThe network forked after block 10041, to help ensure this wallet syncs to correct chain I have added a checkpoint for block 10042.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n### Tech Yadda Yadda:\r\n  \r\n**Spark is a PoW/PoS-based cryptocurrency, now in PoS phase.**\r\n  \r\n* Algorithm: **X11**\r\n* Block Time: **60 Seconds**\r\n* PoW Reward: **200 SPARK reducing to 100 SPARK at block 7200**\r\n* PoW Timeframe: **14400 Blocks (~10 Days)**\r\n* Total PoW: **~2,160,000 SPARK**\r\n* PoS Start: **Block 14000**\r\n* PoS Interest: **17.5%**\r\n* Confirmations: **10, Maturity: 100**\r\n* Minimum stake age: **12 Hours - Unlimited Max**\r\n* P2P port: **16666**\r\n* RPC port: **16667**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
