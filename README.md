Spark Community! development tree

Following network fork and disappearance of dev I have issued this updated wallet so everyone can get back in sync on the majority PoS chain. Changes I have made have been minor, see BTC thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.500 for discussion, and this repo's commit history for details.

The network forked after block 10041, to help ensure this wallet syncs to correct chain I have added a checkpoint for block 10042.
