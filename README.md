## Spark Community! development tree

New version 1.3 released 22nd Nov 2014 - addresses slow block production

	-reduced min PoS difficulty
	-updated difficulty adjustment formula
	-reduced number of blocks required before moved coins can start staking again
	-new seed node

Diff change means a hard fork, set to take effect at block 24630

Following network fork and disappearance of dev I have issued this updated wallet so everyone can get back in sync on the majority PoS chain. Changes I have made have been minor, see BTC thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826767.500 for discussion, and this repo's commit history for details.

The network forked after block 10041, to help ensure this wallet syncs to correct chain I have added a checkpoint for block 10042.
